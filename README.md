# SetAlacrittyFontSize

- A simple example of a dotnet core project that will adjust the size: entry in the ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml file from the commandline. The intent is to compile this to a single executable and have it as a simple linux command to adjust the size of the terminals font from the commandline in ther terminal itself. Easire than opening the config file in an editor like VSCODE and adjusting the size: entry and saving the file back... Overkill perhaps but an experiment none the less..
USAGE

./SetAlacrittyFontSize X

  Where X is the size for the font
